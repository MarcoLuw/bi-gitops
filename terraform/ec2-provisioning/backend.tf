# What is backend.tf briefly?
# This file configures the backend for Terraform state management.
# It specifies where and how the Terraform state is stored, ensuring
# that the state is maintained consistently across different environments
# and team members. In this case, it uses an S3 bucket for remote state storage
# and DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
